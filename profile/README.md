## 🧭 What is ESPnomad?

**ESPnomad** extends [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) to mobile, off-grid living — bringing smart home automation to the road. It’s built for campervans, RVs, boats, tiny houses, expedition trucks, and cabins.

Unlike traditional systems, ESPnomad is:

- 🔌 Designed for 12V/24V/48V DC power
- 🧩 Modular, compact, and DIY-friendly
- 🌐 Integrates natively with Home Assistant
- 🔋 Communicates with EMS/BMS/MPPT systems (Renogy, Victron, Daly, JK, etc.)
- ⚙️ Includes shunt readers, heater controllers, fuse monitoring, tank sensors, and more

## 🚐 Why ESPnomad?

Most automation systems aren’t built for mobile life. ESPnomad is:  
- Low idle power  
- Easy to repair  
- Flexible and brand-agnostic  
- Plug & play for van builders and tinkerers

## 👤 Creator

Built by **Toon**, a Belgian developer and van builder living part-time in a self-converted Peugeot Boxer. Frustrated by fragmented and closed systems, he created ESPnomad as a compact, open-source alternative for the road.
